2. **Centralized Version Control System** (TFS and SVN) (Best used when you would like to collaborate with other team members to work on the same project but there is one issue which is there can be a single point of failure then all the data will be lost if there is no backup)
3. **Distributed Version Control System** (Best suited when you would like to collaborate with others this has the best of both local and central vcs i.e you can have your local commits and also be able to push your changed code on to the server)
